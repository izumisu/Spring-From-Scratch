# Spring-From-Scratch

## Here you come

If you have little Java&Spring development experience, and want to learning Spring development for different reasons, then you just come the right place.

And you think Spring is hard to learn(yes, I do think so), and using all kinds of tools to build a grant-whole Spring project is just impossible.

Just don't worry, let's build from scratch, and go step by step.

## How to

I'm not coding/developing master, just a freshman without seasoned coding. But I just want to show you how I learn, whatever it's good or bad.

I will record the things I learn every weeks, including the code and/or review.

## Q&A

**Why don't you learn on Coursera or Udemy? There are lots of classes!**

Yes, but I don't really get into it. I hate the feeling that following the video(and don't know what to do when my code get error), rather I would love to read the article.

**You are not pro, and you may misleading someone!**

Emm...I just provide a way of learning, you have the freedom to choose whether to read(and star). If you think some steps I took are not quite well, and could be improve, welcome to have a [issue](https://github.com/izumisu/Spring-From-Scratch/issues)/[pull](https://github.com/izumisu/Spring-From-Scratch/pulls), or just ignore.
