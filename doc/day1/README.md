# Day1

Today we will prepare for our develop environment, both front and backend.

## Backend

The tools you need: Docker, IntelliJ Ultimate.

### Docker

It's really annoying to config environment(like mysql) when come to developing, so use [docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/archlinux/) to save your life.

Finish installation, check the version of docker then pull the image of *mysql*:

```
docker -v
docker pull mysql:5.7
```
