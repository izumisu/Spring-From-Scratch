# Week2

In week2:

- Read [Spring tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/spring/) in geeksforgeeks, but most contents I just flipped and have no concept about Spring in mind.
- Go through the [Quickstart](https://spring.io/quickstart) on SpringOfficial, figure out(maybe) some questions like **what is @SpringBoot**, what is **what is DemoApplication.class** etc.
- Learn the Java basic on [w3c](https://www.w3schools.com/java/), I have learned C before, so it wouldn't be a big problem for Java. Just in case, I also take the [mit6.092](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-092-introduction-to-programming-in-java-january-iap-2010/pages/syllabus/), finished [assignment 1~5](https://github.com/izumisu/csdiy/tree/main/mit6092).
