# Week1

---

What I had done on week1 are:

- read the Ai web application project of the company. Of course I can't share you the source, but it's truly long and boring.
- read some articles recommanded by leader. Actually I hadn't finish it, long and tedious, called **Spring Boot 3 and Vue 3 Development Practice(Spring Boot 3 + Vue 3开发实战)**, life-wasted book.
